I am more than happy to write a recommendation letter for you! It’s part of my job, after all. It will save me time, and lead to a better letter, if you can fill out the following information and send it to me in the *text* of an email (i.e. not as an attachment):

**Student Name**: 

**Nature of the Recommendation (i.e. briefly describe the grant or fellowship)**:

**Website Link for the Opportunity**:

**To whom should the recommendation letter be addressed?**:

**How does the letter need to be submitted (e.g. by email, online, by post)?**:

**How do we know each other, and for how long? (E.g. please list the classes you’ve taken, etc.)**:

**What are your educational or career goals? How does this opportunity fit into that trajectory?**:

**Are there specific ideas and themes you would like me to emphasize in the recommendation letter? Any weaknesses in your record you would like me to explain or help minimize?**:

I will send you a confirmation email when I have submitted the recommendation. If you have not heard back from me one week before the deadline, please send me a reminder.
