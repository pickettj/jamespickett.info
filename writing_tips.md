An anayltical essay should consist of an introductory paragraph, clearly defined body paragraphs, and a concluding paragraph. The introductory paragraph should contain a [thesis](https://writingcenter.fas.harvard.edu/pages/developing-thesis) (i.e. overarching argument) broad enough to encapsulate the subtopics of the body paragraphs, but narrow enough that someone could potentially disagree. Each body paragraph should introduce a sub-argument complementary to the larger thesis in the form of a topic sentence, as well as a concluding sentence [bridging into the next body paragraph](https://writingcenter.fas.harvard.edu/pages/transitioning-beware-velcro). The [concluding paragraph](https://writingcenter.fas.harvard.edu/pages/ending-essay-conclusions) should recapitulate the thesis, and perhaps also [anticipate potential criticisms](https://writingcenter.fas.harvard.edu/pages/counter-argument).

Essays will be evaluated first and foremost based on structure, argumentation, and evidence. Style will also be considered as a secondary criterion. Particularly if you have limited experience with analytical writing, it will be helpful to [outline](https://writingcenter.fas.harvard.edu/pages/outlining) in advance, [consult model esssays](https://poorvucenter.yale.edu/ModelPapers#History), read the essay outloud to yourself, and have classmates review it before submission. The [Writing Center](http://www.writingcenter.pitt.edu/. ) is another important resource.

Please keep the following principles in mind:

- Any factual statements must be accompanied by a proper citation, e.g.: (Radishchev, 63). 
  - You are encouraged to use footnotes with the full reference apparatus using the [Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/turabian/Student-Tip-Sheets.html) (especially if you are a history major). However, simple parenthetical references are acceptable so long as they contain the page number and it is clear which assigned reading you are referencing.
  - Cite the *original* page number of the publication, not the pdf page number, whenever possible.
- Prioritize citing primary sources, then secondary works, then textbooks, then lectures, in that order.
  - You may also cite lectures using the following format: (Lecture 4.1).
  - Wikipedia is not a valid source for this exercise (even though it can be an invaluable resource in other contexts), nor are any other websites.
  - You may reference outside readings, but they are not a substitute for assigned readings.
- Keep in mind that in addition to writing a strong essay for its own sake, you are also illustrating your mastery of material covered over the course of the semester. Therefore, it is important to engage with a *diverse* array of sources.
- [Write clearly, avoid jargon, frontload key insights](https://withoutbullshit.com/blog/10-top-writing-tips-psychology).
- There is nothing wrong with using the first person *per se* (e.g. "I argue that..."), but this is not a venue for offering personal opinions or perspectives, however interesting they might be. Rather, you are attempting to persuade the reader to your interpretation of a common body of evidence.
