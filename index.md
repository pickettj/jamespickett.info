I am a historian of Eurasian history at the [University of Pittsburgh](http://www.history.pitt.edu/people/james-pickett), specializing in the history of Islam and empire as entangled sources of authority. My [research](https://pitt.academia.edu/JamesPickett/Journal-Articles) focuses on the "even longer" 19th century, but I am interested in long-term continuities connecting this period both to pre-Islamic antiquity and the Soviet aftermath.

My [teaching](https://pitt.academia.edu/JamesPickett/Syllabi) is wide-ranging, touching on my research themes from multiple angles: from early Islam to the Mongols to imperial Russian history. Capitalizing on Pitt's strength in Slavic studies, I tend to work with graduate students studying Eastern Europe and imperial Russian borderlands.

I live in Pittsburgh. You can reach me at pickettj[at]pitt.edu.
