So you wanna pursue a doctoral degree in history? The following are answers to some of the most common questions I receive from prospective graduate students. They represent one guy's opinion, many of which brilliant colleagues would disagree with, and do not in any way reflect official policies or stances held by the University of Pittsburgh. 

*Should I do it?*: For most people, the answer is "probably not." This is primarily because of the abysmal state of the academic job market. Even if you come in with your eyes wide open, imagining alternative career paths, you will spend at 5-7 years (at least) being habituated to an academic world that will quite likely be closed to you. For many, if not most, that reality is crushing -- even for students with a realistic assessment of the job market.

*What is the best argument in favor of pursuing a PhD in history?*: Life is short, and there are worse ways to spend it than being paid (an extremely modest salary with which it is difficult to make ends meet) to study whatever you want. Even if you do not get to be a historian, you will achieve a level of understanding of your chosen topic that other people simply do not have, and (quite possibly) have a lot of fun along the way.

*What about "alt-ac" career paths?*: 



*How do I write a strong dissertation proposal?*: Here's a dirty secret: no one believes that you will research the dissertation you propose. After all, if you come out of spend 2-3 years in intensive coursework with exactly the same research agenda, what was the point? Think of the proposal as a more research-focused personal statement. You are telling us something about your personality: how you think about history; what kinds of themes you are interested in; how openminded you are; how prepared are you to begin work on day-one; do this student's interest capitalize on a cross-section of the department's strengths rather than just those of the advisor they proposed to work with. You should write a proposal for a topic you would genuinely love to study, of course. But as you formulate the proposal, do so with an idea of what you want to *show* the committee in terms of answers to the "hidden" questions above.





I mentor graduate students studying Eurasia, broadly defined. In practice, this means that I tend to offer training for students situated at the eastern edge of the history departmentâ€™s [Europe cluster][1], or at the western periphery of its [Asia field][2]. Current and past students looking for a recommendation letter should [consult these guidelines][4].

Prospective graduate students should refer to the [History Department website][3]. If you are considering purusing a doctoral degree in history, it is critical to first understand the [state of the humanities](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/08/the-humanities-face-a-crisisof-confidence/567565/) in contemporary US universities and to develop a [clear idea of what you hope to get out of the experience, along with a backup plan](https://hcommons.org/deposits/objects/hc:30062/datastreams/CONTENT/content). [This post provides superb advice](https://chrisblattman.com/2022/01/11/phd-applicants-writing-your-statement-of-purpose/) for writing a strong personal statement.
