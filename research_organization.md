So you are about to start a major research project. No matter what your topic, you will encounter a mountain of material -- far more than you can hope to keep track of without a plan.

## Criteria

There is no single "best" system for swimming through the deluge coming your way: different scholars have different strategies. But, at the very least, you will want to think through the following questions:

- How will you keep track of your secondary citations in the scholarly literature? (Fishing them out of scattered Microsoft Word documents is not going to cut it.)
- How will you efficiently retrieve files from your hard drive and cloud storage? (You can waste a *lot* of time digging through disorganized directories full of opaquely-named files.)
- How will you quickly pull up your notes for reference? (A well-structured system should allow you to pull up the note you are looking for within a few seconds.)
- How will you make sure that your material -- image files, digital notes, photocopies -- will never be lost? If an opportunity comes your way in the field, do you have a means of copying gigabytes worth of data?
- How will you capture different kinds of information during the course of your research? Not only textual information, but also spatial data, images, and network relationships.
- How will you connect your research strategy to your writing strategy? Does your system ensure that you have citations for all of your research ready to go?

## Resources

The following are some links to apps, resources, and techniques I have found helpful for addressing some of these questions. (I also keep [notes for customizing my desktop interface on Github](https://github.com/pickettj/dot_files)):

- Citation management: [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)
  - [Zotfile](http://zotfile.com/): an indispensable Zotero plugin for automatically naming your files and keeping them organized.
- Plain-text / [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) notetaking, searching and reading:
  - [nvAlt](https://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/) (Mac only), soon to be replaced by [nvUltra](https://nvultra.com/): easily search the contents of a directory of plain text notes and read them with Markdown formatting.
    - [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com/): a workaround to sync your nvAlt directory with your smartphone.
  - [Typora](https://typora.io/): a visually pleasing, free app for writing in Markdown.
  - [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/) (Mac only): a subscription-based app for Markdown-based project notes.
- Relational Databases:
  - [Decent introductory video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvrpuBAMddw&ab_channel=PrescottComputerGuy) to the general concept.
  - [Filemaker](https://www.claris.com/filemaker/pro/): proprietary, paid database software (*not necessarily recommended*, but relatively user-friendly).
  - [Python with Pandas](https://datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/09-working-with-sql/index.html): a better solution, which can integrate SQL, but requires some coding.
