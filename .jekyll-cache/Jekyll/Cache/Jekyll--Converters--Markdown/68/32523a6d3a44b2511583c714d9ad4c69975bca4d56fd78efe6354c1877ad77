I"ø<p>I am a historian of Eurasian history at the <a href="http://www.history.pitt.edu/people/james-pickett">University of Pittsburgh</a>, specializing in the history of Islam and empire as entangled sources of authority. My <a href="https://pitt.academia.edu/JamesPickett/Journal-Articles">research</a> focuses on the â€œeven longerâ€ 19th century, but I am interested in long-term continuities connecting this period both to pre-Islamic antiquity and the Soviet aftermath.</p>

<p>My <a href="https://pitt.academia.edu/JamesPickett/Syllabi">teaching</a> is wide-ranging, touching on my research themes from multiple angles: from early Islam to the Mongols to imperial Russian history. Capitalizing on Pittâ€™s strength in Slavic studies, I tend to work with graduate students studying Eastern Europe and imperial Russian borderlands.</p>

<p>I live in Pittsburgh. You can reach me at pickettj[at]pitt.edu.</p>
