My [teaching][1] is wide-ranging, touching on my research themes from multiple angles: from early Islam to the Mongols to imperial Russian history.

I conceive of my undergraduate courses as a loose "Eurasian trilogy," beginning with ["Rise of Islam,"][2] followed by ["Empires of the Steppe,"][3] and culminating with ["Imperial Russia."][4].


## Current and Prospective Students

If you are a current undergraduate student of mine, you will find all course materials on Courseweb. If you are considering taking one of my classes, you can find [sample syllabi at this link][5]. (Caution: students currently enrolled should consult the most up-to-date version of the syllabus on Courseweb, since the sample syllabi may not reflect the current schedule.)

If you are a current or former student who would like me to write a recommendation, please [refer to these guidelines][6].
