My [teaching][1] is wide-ranging, touching on my research themes from multiple angles: from early Islam to the Mongols to imperial Russian history.

## Courses

I conceive of my undergraduate courses as a loose "Eurasian trilogy," beginning with ["Rise of Islam,"][2] followed by ["Empires of the Steppe,"][3] and culminating with ["Imperial Russia."][4] My instructional methodology emphasizes [simulations](https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/teaching-heroes) and [hands-on activities](https://www.honorscollege.pitt.edu/islam).

I also teach a "sequel" of sorts to "Rise of Islam" for the Religious Studies department entitled "[Islam in Asia](https://www.academia.edu/44017356/Islam_in_Asia_Syllabus_)," which focuses on religion outside of the Middle East from the post-Mongol period to the present.

Digital humanities is increasingly a teaching focus of mine as well: in spring 2020 I team-taught “[Computational Methods in the Humanities][5]” with [David Birnbaum][6] (Pitt Slavic Studies).


## Current and Prospective Students

If you are a current undergraduate student of mine, you will find all course materials on Canvas. If you are considering taking one of my classes, you can find [sample syllabi at this link][7]. (Caution: students currently enrolled should consult the most up-to-date version of the syllabus on Canvas, since the sample syllabi may not reflect the current schedule.) I have also composed a set of [generalized writing guidelines](http://jamespickett.info/writing_tips) and useful links.

If you are a current or former student who would like me to write a recommendation, please [refer to these guidelines][9].
