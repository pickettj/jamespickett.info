I conceive of my undergraduate courses as a loose "Eurasian trilogy," beginning with ["Rise of Islam,"](https://www.academia.edu/38158975/Rise_of_Islam_Syllabus_) followed by ["Empires of the Steppe,"](https://www.academia.edu/28288742/Empires_of_the_Steppe_Eurasia_from_the_Mongols_to_the_Soviet_Union_Syllabus_) and culiminating with ["Imperial Russia."](https://www.academia.edu/37326736/Imperial_Russia_Syllabus_).
