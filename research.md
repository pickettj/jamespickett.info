My research focuses on the social history of Russia’s Central Asian periphery in the eighteenth – twentieth centuries. I consider my work equally part of Islamic, Russian, Persianate, Central Asian, and - increasingly - South Asian studies.

## Polymaths of Islam
My first book-length research project is a social and cultural history of Islamic scholars in Bukhara (now located in Uzbekistan) during the "even longer" 19th century. It will be published by Cornell University Press in 2020. I have published related work in the [*International Jouranal of Middle East Studies*](https://www.academia.edu/26854228/Nadir_Shahs_Peculiar_Central_Asian_Legacy_Empire_Conversion_Narratives_and_the_Rise_of_New_Scholarly_Dynasties) (2016) and the [*Journal of Persianate Studies*](https://www.academia.edu/17884935/Enemies_beyond_the_Red_Sands_The_Bukhara-Khiva_Dynamic_as_Mediated_by_Textual_Genre) (2016_.

## Seeing like a Princely State
I am now beginning a second book-length investigation of sovereignty Perso-Islamic cultures of documentation in semi-colonial contexts, which will compare Bukhara as a Russian protectorate with Hyderabad as a British princely state. A recent article with the [*American Historical Review*](https://www.academia.edu/36900273/Written_into_Submission_Reassessing_Sovereignty_through_a_Forgotten_Eurasian_Dynasty) 2018) sets the ground work for this project by exploring sovereignty in Eurasia during the precolonial period.

## Side Projects
These interests have led me toward a number of more self-contained projects. I have written about the [Soviet legacy of the Persianate cultural sphere](https://www.academia.edu/7611983/Soviet_Civilization_through_a_Persian_Lens_Iranian_Intellectuals_Cultural_Diplomacy_and_Socialist_Modernity_1941-1955). I have also investigated the implications of Central Asian history for teaching Persian and Turkic langauges of Central Asia both for a [scholarly](https://www.academia.edu/33025103/Categorically_Misleading_Dialectically_Misconceived_Language_Textbooks_and_Pedagogic_Participation_in_Central_Asian_Nation-building_Projects) and [popular audience](https://eurasianet.org/on-language-the-many-flavors-of-persian-in-eurasia). Most recently, I have begun work on a synthetic encyclopedia article on Persianate migration, building on my recent contribution to [*Asia inside Out*](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674987630).
