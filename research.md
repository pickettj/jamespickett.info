My [research][1] focuses on the "even longer" 19th century, but I am interested in enduring continuities connecting this period both to pre-Islamic antiquity and to the Soviet aftermath. I consider my work equally part of Islamic, Russian, Persianate, Central Asian, and - increasingly - South Asian studies. You can find a complete list of publications on my [curriculum vitae][2] or my [public Zotero library][3].

## Polymaths of Islam
My first book-length research project is a social and cultural history of Islamic scholars in Bukhara (now located in Uzbekistan) during the "even longer" 19th century. It will be published by Cornell University Press in 2020. I have published related work in the [*International Journal of Middle East Studies*][4] (2016) and the [*Journal of Persianate Studies*][5] (2016).

## Seeing like a Princely State
I am now beginning a second book-length investigation of sovereignty Perso-Islamic cultures of documentation in semi-colonial contexts, which will compare Bukhara as a Russian protectorate with Hyderabad as a British princely state. A recent article with the [*American Historical Review*][6] (2018) lays the ground work for this project by exploring sovereignty in Eurasia during the precolonial period; and an introduction (co-authored with [Paolo Sartori][7]) to a theme issue of the [*Journal of the Social and Economic History of the Orient*][8] (2019) argues for a new approach to the study of Islamic documents.

## Side Projects
These interests have led me toward a number of more self-contained projects. I have written about the [Soviet legacy of the Persianate cultural sphere][9]. I have also investigated the implications of Central Asian history for teaching Persian and Turkic langauges of Central Asia both for a [scholarly][10] and [popular audience][11]. Most recently, I have begun work on a synthetic encyclopedia article on Persianate migration, building on my recent contribution to [*Asia Inside Out*][12].
