I mentor graduate students studying Eurasia, broadly defined. In practice, this means that I tend to offer training for students situated at the eastern edge of the history departmentâ€™s [Europe cluster][1], or at the western periphery of its [Asia field][2]. Current and past students looking for a recommendation letter should [consult these guidelines][4].

Prospective graduate students should refer to the [History Department website][3]. If you are considering purusing a doctoral degree in history, it is critical to first understand the [state of the humanities](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/08/the-humanities-face-a-crisisof-confidence/567565/) in contemporary US universities and to develop a [clear idea of what you hope to get out of the experience, along with a backup plan](https://hcommons.org/deposits/objects/hc:30062/datastreams/CONTENT/content). [This post provides superb advice](https://chrisblattman.com/2022/01/11/phd-applicants-writing-your-statement-of-purpose/) for writing a strong personal statement.
