I mentor graduate students studying Eurasia, broadly defined. In practice, this means that I tend to offer training for students situated at the eastern edge of the history departmentâ€™s [Europe cluster][1], or at the western periphery of its [Asia field][2].

Prospective graduate students should refer to the [History Department website][3]. Current and past students looking for a recommendation letter should [consult these guidelines][4].
